There is a lack on the internet of a centralized space to explore Flamengo's glories. This project provide a place to search for historical facts, pictures and statistics of Flamengo main titles. For example, search for the names of the winning squad from Libertadores 1981, or check if the legendary squad from 2019 scored more goals than 2009s winners.
